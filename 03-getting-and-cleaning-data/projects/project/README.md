Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the data, markdown file, output files, and script file from the course project for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.

There are 3 directories:
- markdown
- output
- script

The **markdown** directory contains the markdown file describing the variables and data processing steps.<br/>
The **output** directory contains the tidy data set files created.<br/>
The **script** directory contains the script (run_analysis.R) used to create the tidy data sets from the raw data files.<br/>

To see the description of variables and processing steps, see **codebook.Rmd**.<br/>
To verify the generation of tidy data sets, run the script **run_analysis.R**.<br/>
The script is self-contained in that it will take care of all the processing steps from downloading the data files to generating the final tidy data sets.
